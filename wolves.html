    <h1>Why Are Young Dogs Getting "Old Age" Diseases?</h1>

    <h2>The Kibble Myth</h2>
    <p>Have you ever heard the argument that domesticated dogs live longer than wild wolves because we have veterinary care, while wolves eat raw food that supposedly kills them faster? Some people even claim that dogs today get "perfectly formulated" nutrition through kibble. But that idea doesn't really hold up.</p>
    <p>Kibble isn't formulated to help dogs thrive, it's made to be cheap, shelf-stable, and profitable. It's ultra-processed, full of oxidized fats, synthetic additives, and low-quality byproducts. By the time it hits the bag, there are barely any living, bioavailable nutrients left. Meanwhile, wolves in the wild eat raw, unprocessed food: fresh meat, bones, organs, and fur—the diet their bodies evolved to handle.</p>
    <p>So when we see domesticated dogs developing cancer, kidney failure, and heart disease at younger and younger ages, we have to ask: is it really the absence of modern vet care in the wild that shortens lifespan, or could our interventions, and processed lifestyle, be making dogs sicker in the long run?</p>

    <h2>The Real Reason Wolves Die Young (And It's Not What You Think)</h2>
    <p>When people argue that domestic dogs are healthier because they live longer, they're missing a crucial point about why wolves actually die young. Let's look at the real data:</p>
    <p><strong>Wild wolves die from:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Human activities (hunting, vehicle strikes, poaching): 60–84% of deaths</li>
        <li>Pack fights and territorial disputes: 20–40% of natural deaths</li>
        <li>Starvation during harsh winters or prey scarcity: 30–50% of natural deaths</li>
        <li>Hunting injuries from large prey: 5–10% of natural deaths</li>
        <li>Disease and parasites: Only 10–20% of natural deaths</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice something important here? Wolves aren't dying from the chronic diseases we see in dogs. They're dying from violence, starvation, and accidents—things that simply don't affect house pets.</p>
    <p><strong>Domesticated dogs die from:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cancer: 33–50% of all deaths</li>
        <li>Heart disease: 15–22%</li>
        <li>Kidney disease: 10–11%</li>
        <li>Chronic organ failure and age-related diseases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The wolves that do live to old age in captivity (where they're protected from human interference and starvation) don't typically develop the same chronic diseases we see in kibble-fed dogs. This suggests that raw diet and natural lifestyle actually support long-term health better than our modern interventions.</p>

    <h2>The Part That Should Terrify Every Dog Owner</h2>
    <p>But here's where it gets really concerning. We're not just seeing these diseases in old dogs anymore. I'm talking about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2-year-old dogs with lymphoma</li>
        <li>6-month-old puppies with autoimmune diseases</li>
        <li>4-year-old dogs with kidney failure</li>
        <li>Young dogs with heart problems that used to only show up in seniors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn't "better veterinary care detecting problems earlier." This is an epidemic of chronic disease in animals that should be in their prime.</p>

    <h2>What's Really Happening to Our Dogs</h2>
    <p>Research is starting to paint a disturbing picture. A 2021 study found that dogs eating dry kibble consume roughly four times more acrylamide than humans do. Acrylamide is a known carcinogen that forms when starchy foods are cooked at high temperatures—exactly what happens when making kibble.</p>
    <p>The study on ultra-processed foods noted something chilling: "Twice as many dogs die of cancer than humans, in whom the incidence is one in four individuals. Unlike most humans, though, the majority of dogs, unfortunately, eat exclusively tinned or dry kibbled ultra-processed foods every single day for their entire lives."</p>

    <p>Let that sink in. We're feeding our dogs the equivalent of a human living entirely on processed snack foods, then wondering why they're getting sick.</p>
