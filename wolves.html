    <h1>Why Are Young Dogs Getting "Old Age" Diseases?</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>The Kibble Myth</h2>
    <p>Many believe that domestic dogs live longer than wolves because of veterinary care and "perfectly formulated" kibble. But kibble isn't designed for longevity—it's designed for shelf-life and profit. Made with ultra-processed ingredients, oxidized fats, and synthetic additives, it lacks the bioavailable nutrients dogs need to thrive.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Wolves vs. Dogs: What the Data Shows</h2>
    <p>Wolves in the wild die from things like hunting, starvation, and injury—not chronic disease. In contrast, domestic dogs die from cancer, heart disease, and organ failure—often at younger ages than ever before. Captive wolves living on raw diets don't show the same patterns of illness, pointing to lifestyle and diet as critical factors.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Shocking Rise of Chronic Illness in Young Dogs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-year-olds with lymphoma</li>
        <li>6-month-old puppies with autoimmune disease</li>
        <li>4-year-olds with kidney failure</li>
        <li>Heart disease in young adults</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not early detection—this is early disease.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Role of Ultra-Processed Food</h2>
    <p>A 2021 study revealed that kibble-fed dogs consume 4x more acrylamide than humans. Acrylamide is a carcinogen formed when starches are cooked at high heat—exactly how kibble is made. Dogs eating these foods daily face constant exposure to harmful compounds.</p>

<section>
    <h2>The Toxic Load of Modern Dog Life</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines in early puppyhood</li>
        <li>Monthly pesticide treatments</li>
        <li>Continuous exposure to household/lawn chemicals</li>
        <li>Fluoridated tap water</li>
        <li>Sedentary lifestyles and chronic stress</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Compare this with the wolf’s natural lifestyle: raw diet, intense exercise, natural social structure, and no synthetic chemical exposure.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Longevity vs. Quality of Life</h2>
    <p>It's not just about living longer—it's about living better. Chronic illness isn't just affecting senior dogs; it's becoming the new normal for young ones. When "old age" diseases hit a 3-year-old, it’s time to rethink what we call healthy.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What’s Causing These Diseases?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Kibble:</strong> Advanced glycation end products, acrylamide, oxidized fats = systemic inflammation</li>
        <li><strong>Preventatives:</strong> Neurotoxins like isoxazolines overwhelm detox systems</li>
        <li><strong>Vaccination overload:</strong> Aluminum adjuvants trigger immune dysfunction</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical exposure:</strong> Hormone disruption, DNA damage, cellular interference</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Feed real food:</strong> Raw or gently cooked, species-appropriate diets</li>
        <li><strong>Limit chemical exposure:</strong> Skip unnecessary pesticides, clean products</li>
        <li><strong>Test before you vaccinate:</strong> Use titer testing</li>
        <li><strong>Encourage natural behaviors:</strong> Dirt, sun, movement, social time</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Our dogs are trusting us to protect them, not just medicate them. Modern interventions are convenient, but the cost to our dogs’ health is becoming undeniable. Instead of asking how to treat disease, we need to ask why it's happening in the first place—and start making choices that truly support their well-being.</p>
