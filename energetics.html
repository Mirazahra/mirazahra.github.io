        <h2>Importance of Food Quality</h2>
        <p>The energetics of proteins can be significantly affected by how they are raised and fed. For example, cattle raised in feedlots often have warming properties due to stress and poor diets, whereas 100% grass-fed and finished beef tends to be neutral. Similarly, animals raised in healthy, low-stress environments will reflect their energetic state more accurately.</p>
        <p>This highlights the importance of choosing high-quality foods for our dogs. The right nutrition not only supports physical health but also maintains energetic balance, leading to improved overall well-being.</p>

        <h2>Energetics of Disease in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)</h2>
        <p>In TCM, diseases are often understood through the lens of energetics, with conditions classified as hot, cold, or imbalanced. This perspective helps in diagnosing and treating health issues by restoring balance to the body’s energy.</p>
